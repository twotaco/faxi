## Executive Summary

### Core Messaging Philosophy

**SOLUTION SELLING, NOT FEATURE SELLING**

The elderly don't want to "use the internet" or "access online services." They want to:
- **Stay independent** - handle their own affairs without burdening family
- **Participate in modern life** - not be left behind as services go digital
- **Maintain dignity** - feel capable and self-sufficient
- **Access services that are increasingly online-only** - out of necessity, not desire

**Wrong approach**: "Access the internet through your fax machine"
**Right approach**: "Stay Independent. Stay Connected. Shop online. Book appointments. Get answers. All by fax."

The fax machine is the HOW, not the WHAT. The WHAT is independence, dignity, and participation.

---

### Strategic Approach

Faxi's website must serve three distinct audiences with different needs, decision-making processes, and communication preferences. The strategy employs:

1. **Adaptive Homepage**: Dynamic content that responds to user behavior and intent signals
2. **Audience-Specific Pages**: Dedicated pages optimized for each ICP's journey
3. **Clear Navigation**: Intuitive paths for each audience to find relevant information
4. **Conversion Optimization**: Tailored CTAs and conversion funnels for each ICP
5. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Japanese cultural values embedded throughout design and messaging

### Key Success Metrics

**Elder-Offline-Fax-Users**:
- Phone inquiry rate: 2-4% of visitors
- Trial signup rate: 1-2% of visitors
- Conversion to paid: 60-70% of trials

**Online-Families**:
- Click-through rate: 3-5%
- Trial signup rate: 5-8% of visitors
- Time to decision: 3-7 days average

**Business Partners**:
- Lead generation rate: 2-3% of visitors
- SQL conversion: 30-40% of leads
- Sales cycle length: 3-6 months

## 1. Homepage Messaging Strategy

### Overview

The homepage serves as the primary entry point for all three ICPs. The strategy employs adaptive content that responds to user signals while maintaining a cohesive brand experience.

### Adaptive Content Approach

**Detection Signals**:
- **Referral source**: Direct mail campaign (elderly), Google search (families), LinkedIn (business)
- **Device type**: Desktop (business), mobile (families), tablet (mixed)
- **Time on page**: Quick scan (business), moderate (families), slow (elderly)
- **Scroll depth**: Shallow (business - looking for specific info), deep (families - researching)
- **Click patterns**: Phone number (elderly), trial signup (families), demo request (business)

**Content Variations**:
1. **Default/Mixed Audience**: Balanced messaging highlighting all value propositions
2. **Elder-Focused**: Emphasize familiarity, independence, simplicity
3. **Family-Focused**: Emphasize peace of mind, time savings, parent independence
4. **Business-Focused**: Emphasize market opportunity, ROI, competitive advantage

### Homepage Structure
