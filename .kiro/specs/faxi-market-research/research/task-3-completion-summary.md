## Pain Points Identified for Faxi Positioning

### Top 6 Pain Points (with willingness to pay):

1. **Geographic Distance Barrier**
   - Severity: High
   - Willingness to Pay: ¥5,000-15,000/month

2. **Technology Gap and Digital Divide**
   - Severity: High
   - Willingness to Pay: ¥3,000-10,000/month

3. **Caregiving Burden and Stress**
   - Severity: High
   - Willingness to Pay: ¥10,000-30,000/month

6. **Time Constraints**
   - Severity: High
   - Willingness to Pay: ¥8,000-20,000/month

## Strategic Implications for Faxi

### Value Proposition for Online-Families
1. **Reduce Geographic Barriers**: Enable parents to access services without physical presence
2. **Bridge Technology Gap**: Parents use familiar fax, children benefit from digital integration
3. **Peace of Mind**: Monitor and support parents without constant intervention
4. **Time Efficiency**: Reduce time spent on errands and coordination
5. **Enable Independence**: Parents maintain autonomy while staying connected

### Messaging Considerations
- Emphasize family harmony (和, wa) and reduced burden
- Respect for elderly autonomy and dignity
- Bridge between traditional values and modern needs
- Enable filial piety through technology (not replace it)
- Address guilt and worry on both sides

### Decision-Making Strategy
- Target adult children as primary researchers and recommenders
- Provide information that children can share with parents
- Enable trial periods for family evaluation
- Price point under ¥30,000/month for easier family approval (ideally ¥980-1,980/month)
- Emphasize joint benefits for both generations
