- Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, "Family Income and Expenditure Survey 2023", September 2023, https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kakei/index.html, accessed November 27, 2024

**Income Distribution (Elderly 65+)**:
- Under ¥2M/year: 28.3% (likely cannot afford)
- ¥2M-3M/year: 43.4% (Basic tier target)
- ¥3M-5M/year: 19.6% (Premium tier candidates)
- Over ¥5M/year: 8.7% (Premium tier target)

**Affordability Analysis**:
- Basic tier (¥980/month = ¥11,760/year): 0.4-0.6% of ¥2M-3M income
- Premium tier (¥1,980/month = ¥23,760/year): 0.5-0.8% of ¥3M-5M income
- Both tiers within acceptable discretionary spending (1-2% of income)

**Competitive Pricing**:
- Mobile phone plans: ¥1,000-3,000/month
- Internet service: ¥3,000-5,000/month
- Cable TV: ¥2,000-4,000/month

### Tier Distribution Assumptions

**Base Case**: 70% Basic / 30% Premium

**Rationale**:

- 71.7% of elderly have income ≥ ¥2M (can afford Basic)
- 28.3% have income ≥ ¥3M (Premium candidates)
- Conservative estimate: not all high-income users choose Premium

**Optimistic Case**: 60% Basic / 40% Premium
- Strong value perception drives Premium adoption
- Family members pay for Premium tier
- Premium features (24/7 support) highly valued

**Pessimistic Case**: 80% Basic / 20% Premium
- Price sensitivity dominates decision
- Basic features sufficient for most users
- Premium adoption slower than expected
