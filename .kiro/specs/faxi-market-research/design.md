# Faxi Market Research Design

## Overview

This design document outlines a comprehensive market research framework for Faxi's four primary Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs): elder-offline-fax-users, online-families, business partners, and investors. The research will produce actionable insights that directly inform business strategy, market positioning, and website marketing copy.

The deliverable is a structured market research document organized by ICP, containing demographic profiles, psychographic insights, pain point analysis, buying journey maps, competitive positioning, market sizing, value propositions, messaging frameworks, and customer acquisition strategies. Each section will include quantitative data from credible sources and qualitative insights from cultural analysis.

This research will enable Faxi to craft compelling, evidence-based marketing narratives that resonate with each audience segment while maintaining cultural appropriateness for the Japanese market.

## Correctness Properties

*A property is a characteristic or behavior that should hold true across all valid executions of a system—essentially, a formal statement about what the system should do. Properties serve as the bridge between human-readable specifications and machine-verifiable correctness guarantees.*


### Property Reflection

After reviewing the prework analysis, most acceptance criteria are documentation requirements about *what content to include* rather than *computational properties that can be tested*. However, we identified several structural and data quality properties that can be validated:

**Testable Properties Identified**:
1. Documentation completeness checks (examples for specific sections)
2. Market sizing hierarchy constraints (SAM ≤ TAM, SOM ≤ SAM)
3. Citation and source attribution requirements (all statistics must have sources)

**Redundancy Analysis**:
- Properties 8.1 and 8.5 both relate to source citations but cover different aspects (8.1 is about credibility of sources, 8.5 is about citation completeness)
- Properties 5.2 and 5.3 both validate market sizing hierarchy but for different levels (TAM→SAM vs SAM→SOM)
- These are complementary rather than redundant

**Key Insight**: This spec is primarily about *research methodology and documentation standards* rather than *computational logic*. The properties focus on ensuring the research document meets quality standards for completeness, data integrity, and proper attribution.

Property 1: Market sizing hierarchy consistency
*For any* market sizing analysis, SAM must be less than or equal to TAM, and SOM must be less than or equal to SAM
**Validates: Requirements 5.2, 5.3**

Property 2: Statistical source attribution
*For any* market statistic or demographic data point in the research document, there must be a credible source citation including the source name and publication date
**Validates: Requirements 8.1, 8.5**

## Error Handling

### Research Data Quality Issues

**Missing Data Sources**:
- **Detection**: Automated scan for statistics without citations
- **Resolution**: Flag for manual research and citation addition
- **Prevention**: Template requires source field for all quantitative claims

**Inconsistent Market Sizing**:
- **Detection**: Validation checks for TAM ≥ SAM ≥ SOM
- **Resolution**: Review calculations and assumptions
- **Prevention**: Automated validation before document finalization

**Outdated Statistics**:
- **Detection**: Check publication dates of all sources
- **Resolution**: Research updated statistics from same or equivalent sources
- **Prevention**: Set data freshness requirements (e.g., within 3 years)

**Incomplete ICP Profiles**:
- **Detection**: Checklist validation against template requirements
- **Resolution**: Conduct additional research for missing sections
- **Prevention**: Use structured templates with required fields

### Cultural Sensitivity Issues

**Inappropriate Messaging**:
- **Detection**: Cultural review by native Japanese speakers
- **Resolution**: Revise messaging to align with cultural norms
- **Prevention**: Include cultural guidelines in messaging framework

**Translation Errors**:
- **Detection**: Professional translation review
- **Resolution**: Correct translations and update glossary
- **Prevention**: Use professional translation services, not machine translation

## Testing Strategy

### Document Validation Testing

Since this spec produces a research document rather than executable code, testing focuses on document quality and completeness:

**Structural Validation**:
- Verify all required sections are present for each ICP
- Check that all templates are properly filled out
- Validate document formatting and organization

**Data Quality Validation**:
- Verify all statistics have source citations
- Check that market sizing follows TAM ≥ SAM ≥ SOM hierarchy
- Validate that projections include assumptions and scenarios
- Ensure demographic data includes methodology where available

**Content Completeness Validation**:
- Checklist review for each ICP profile section
- Verify all competitor profiles include required fields
- Check that messaging frameworks include all components
- Validate acquisition channel analysis includes required metrics

**Cultural Appropriateness Review**:
- Native Japanese speaker review of all Japanese-language content
- Cultural consultant review of messaging and positioning
- Validation of business culture assumptions

### Property-Based Testing

Given the nature of this spec (research documentation), traditional property-based testing is limited. However, we can implement validation properties:

**Property Test 1: Market Sizing Hierarchy**
- Generate various market sizing scenarios
- Verify TAM ≥ SAM ≥ SOM always holds
- Test with edge cases (zero values, equal values)
- **Validates: Requirements 5.2, 5.3**

**Property Test 2: Citation Completeness**
- Parse document for all quantitative claims
- Verify each has associated source citation
- Check citation format includes required fields
- **Validates: Requirements 8.1, 8.5**

### Manual Review Process

**Peer Review**:
- Marketing team reviews messaging frameworks
- Finance team reviews revenue projections
- Product team reviews competitive analysis
- Cultural consultant reviews Japanese content

**Stakeholder Validation**:
- Present findings to leadership team
- Gather feedback on strategic recommendations
- Validate assumptions with domain experts
- Iterate based on feedback

**External Validation**:
- Compare findings with industry reports
- Validate market sizing with third-party data
- Test messaging with focus groups (if budget allows)
- Consult with Japan market experts
