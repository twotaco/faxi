Dear AWS SES Team,

Thank you for reviewing our request. I'm happy to provide detailed information about our use case for Amazon SES.

SERVICE OVERVIEW

Service Name: Faxi
Website: https://faxi.jp
Domain for Sending: me.faxi.jp
Service Type: Fax-to-Internet Bridge for Elderly Users

Faxi is a social impact service that enables elderly Japanese citizens without internet access to send and receive emails through traditional fax machines. Our service bridges the digital divide by converting faxes to emails and emails to faxes, allowing offline users to communicate with family members and access online services.

EMAIL USE CASE DETAILS

1. How We Use Amazon SES

We use SES for two primary purposes:

A. Inbound Email Processing:
- Users are automatically assigned email addresses in the format: {phone_number}@me.faxi.jp
- When someone sends an email to a user's Faxi email address, SES receives it
- We convert the email to a fax and deliver it to the user's fax machine
- This allows offline users to receive emails from family, friends, and services

B. Outbound Email Sending:
- When a user faxes an email request to our service, we extract the recipient and message
- We send the email on behalf of the user from their @me.faxi.jp address
- We send confirmation faxes back to users confirming delivery or reporting errors
- All emails are transactional and user-initiated

2. Sending Frequency and Volume

Current Status: Development/Testing Phase

Expected Volume:
- Initial Launch (Month 1-3): 500-1,000 emails/day
- Growth Phase (Month 4-12): 2,000-5,000 emails/day
- Steady State: 5,000-10,000 emails/day

Sending Pattern:
- Emails are sent in response to user fax requests (event-driven)
- Peak hours: 9 AM - 6 PM JST (business hours)
- No bulk sending or marketing campaigns
- 100% transactional emails only

3. Recipient List Management

How Recipients Are Determined:
- Inbound: Recipients are our registered users (verified by phone number)
- Outbound: Recipients are specified by users in their fax requests
- We do NOT maintain marketing lists or send unsolicited emails
- Every email is either:
  * Sent TO a user (inbound email-to-fax conversion)
  * Sent FROM a user to their specified recipient (outbound user request)

User Registration:
- Users are automatically registered when they send their first fax
- Each user gets a unique email address based on their verified phone number
- Users opt-in by using the service

4. Bounce and Complaint Management

Bounce Handling:
- We configure SES to send bounce notifications to our backend via SNS webhooks
- Our system processes these notifications automatically:
  * Hard bounces: We send an error notification fax to the user explaining the email couldn't be delivered
  * Soft bounces: We retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
  * Persistent bounce addresses are flagged and users are notified via fax
- All bounce events are logged in our audit system for monitoring

Complaint Handling:
- We configure SES to send complaint notifications to our backend via SNS webhooks
- Our system processes these notifications automatically:
  * Any complaint triggers immediate investigation by our team
  * Users are notified via fax if their outbound email generated a complaint
  * We provide guidance to users on proper email etiquette
- We maintain a complaint rate target of < 0.1%
- Repeated complaints from a user result in account review and potential service restrictions

Unsubscribe and Blocking:
- For inbound emails (email-to-fax): Users can fax us to block specific sender addresses
  * Example: "Block emails from spammer@example.com"
  * We maintain per-user blocklists to prevent unwanted faxes
  * Users can also request to unblock addresses if needed
- For outbound emails (fax-to-email): Recipients can reply to the user requesting no further contact
  * The user receives this as a fax and can choose to stop emailing that person
- We include clear sender identification in all emails
- Users control their own email sending and receiving preferences through fax requests
